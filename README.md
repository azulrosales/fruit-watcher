# ProduceWatcher: An Adaptive Classifier for Identifying Produce Conditions
ProduceWatcher is a continual learning-based classifier designed to identify and classify different produce conditions. The system is capable of adapting to new classes over time by using the APER BN (Adaptive Progressive Experience Replay with Batch Normalization) strategy and a pretrained ResNet18 backbone.
